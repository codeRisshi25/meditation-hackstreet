<h2 align="center">"Grow Your Calm, Grow a Forest: A Meditation Website for Positive Impact"</h2>
<h3 align="justify">MediTree is a meditation website that combines mindfulness with environmental impact. Through this website, users can meditate while growing a virtual tree that represents their progress. Once the tree matures, a real tree will be planted in the user's name by our partnering NGO. This project aims to promote mental well-being and environmental sustainability simultaneously.</h3>
